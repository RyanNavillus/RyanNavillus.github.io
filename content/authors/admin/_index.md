I'm a PhD student at the University of Maryland studying reinforcement learning advised by [John P. Dickerson](http://jpdickerson.com/index.html). I am one of the developers of PettingZoo for multiagent environments and contributed to multiple open source tools for RL. My research is focused on understanding existing deep reinforcement algorithms and developing new methods that solve complex, real-word problems. Right now I'm interested in automatically generating curriculums for RL agents to solve challenging tasks and enable open-ended learning. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to dicsuss ideas or opportunities to collaborate!
